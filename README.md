- Section or Div?
- Where do I learn CSS? Udacity has a good starting point for responsiveness
- How do they create that small icon card to show in the input for card number
- Why do they not use the word function?
- JS events https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events (onclick vs addeventlistener)

## TO DO
- Center some elements
- Enter Promo Code Interactivity

## New things learned
- Clear the float whenever you need to get a new line after a float:left
- If working with a forked repository you will probably want to add a new remote
  - git remote add upstream ULR_GIT_REPO
- If you need to list your remotes use:
  - git remote -v 
- TODO comments only work in programming languages (JS) and not for HTML (markup language)
- Chrome browser will recognize a credit card input if you use the the attribute name="cardNumber" or placeholder="Card Number*"
- Input pattern attribute only suggest when you over an input and wrote another thing to write the requested format.
- HTML5 discourages the use of type=text/javascript https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51418964/script-type-text-javascript-vs-script-type-module
- onclick is a bad practice https://www.simonewebdesign.it/onclick-vs-addeventlistener/
